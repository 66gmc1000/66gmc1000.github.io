After a bit of trial-and-error, and some youtubing I was able to get a site up and running on GitHub Pages very quickly! With that said, there were some things I found unclear so I&rsquo;m going to attempt to write a step-by-step of what I went through to help others have a smoother time getting their website up and running!</p><p>You can also follow the <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/>Hugo Install Page</a> for Windows or Linux, as this post is on MacOS! If you do that you can skip to the Getting Started with Hugo section of this post!</p><h2 id=installing-homebrew>Installing Homebrew
<a class=heading-link href=#installing-homebrew><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p><strong>Note: If you have Homebrew you can skip to downloading go</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m going to start with no assumptions here so we will begin by having you install homebrew for MacOS which is super simple and makes life with other tasks way more simple later!Open the terminal by pressing Command + Space and typing &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; then pressing enter, then copy and paste the following (You should be in your Home directory):</p><pre><code> /usr/bin/ruby -e &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)&quot;
</code></pre><p>You&rsquo;ll want to accept any prompts that are thrown and BAM! done! You can now get brewing! (Note: Check out <a href=https://brew.sh/>Homebrew</a> which is where I got this code). This will make the next couple steps much nicer!</p><h2 id=installing-go>Installing Go
<a class=heading-link href=#installing-go><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p><strong>Note: If you have Go already installed go ahead and skip this as well!</strong></p><p>Now that you have homebrew, to install Go you will need to type the following into the terminal:</p><p>Again, accept any prompts until the download is complete and you will end up with Go installed! If you don&rsquo;t know what Go is it&rsquo;s a programming language created by Google, which is becoming more popular everyday, Hugo will leverage this language to create the website framework. If you are interested in more about Go, <a href=https://golang.org/doc/>Go here</a> (Pun intended)</p><p>If you are here you should have the following installed:</p><h2 id=installing-hugo>Installing Hugo
<a class=heading-link href=#installing-hugo><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>Now for installing Hugo, as you might have guessed installing Hugo is just as simple as the previous two installs. Simply type the following:</p><p>That&rsquo;s it! we are ready to begin working with Hugo!</p><h2 id=setting-up-for-hugo>Setting up for Hugo
<a class=heading-link href=#setting-up-for-hugo><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden=true></i></a></h2><p>Let&rsquo;s set up a directory to do all our work in. In your terminal go to your home directory by typing the following:</p><p><code>cd ~</code></p><p>then to make a directory name &ldquo;Sites&rdquo; type: <code>mkdir Sites</code></p><p>move into that directory <code>cd Sites</code></p><p>Now that you&rsquo;re in the Sites directory you can now begin to work with Hugo here.<br>The first step is really simple type:</p><pre><code>hugo new site yoursitename
</code></pre><p>The hugo new site command will will create the skeleton of your site. You should see the following prompt after you execute the command</p><pre><code>Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/YourName/Sites/yoursitename.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/, or
   create your own with the &quot;hugo new theme &quot; command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with &quot;hugo new /.&quot;.
3. Start the built-in live server via &quot;hugo server&quot;.

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.    
</code></pre><p>These direction are the next steps you need to take to get your site where you want it. We are going to go over them lightly so you can understand what these components are and how to interact with them. Now you should <code>cd yoursitename</code> and then <code>ls</code> to check out the directory and you will see the following:</p><pre><code>archetypes content layouts static config.toml themes data
</code></pre><p>This is the skeleton of your Hugo site, it is here where you will work with creating new content for your site which I&rsquo;ve cover once we get your site posted to GitHub. The important thing to notice here is the <code>theme</code> directory. The theme directory is where you will be customizing your site.</p></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>2021</p></section></footer></main><script src=/js/coder.min.235666b114443867d43eeb5799d51f6252965e5163f338285e113fa381d3d27e.js integrity="sha256-I1ZmsRREOGfUPutXmdUfYlKWXlFj8zgoXhE/o4HT0n4="></script><script>(function(e,b,f,c,a,d){b[c]=b[c]||function(){(b[c].q=b[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},a=e.createElement('script'),d=e.getElementsByTagName('script')[0],a.async=1,a.src=f,a.id='fathom-script',d.parentNode.insertBefore(a,d)})(document,window,'//analytics.example.com/tracker.js','fathom'),fathom('set','siteId','ABCDE'),fathom('trackPageview')</script><script async defer data-domain=example.com src=https://analytics.example.com/js/plausible.js></script><script data-goatcounter=https://ovenell-guru.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></body></html>
